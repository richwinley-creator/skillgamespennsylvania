                            <p>Skill games require player interaction and decision-making that directly affects the outcome. Players must demonstrate skill to win. Slot machines, by contrast, produce purely random results. This legal distinction is why Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court ruled skill games are not gambling devices.</p>

                            <p>No. Unlike slot machines or video gaming terminals, skill games do not currently require a state gaming license in Pennsylvania. Your existing business license is sufficient. Skill games can be placed in bars, restaurants, convenience stores, game rooms, laundromats, and other establishments. Note that legislation is being considered that may introduce a licensing framework in the future.</p>
