## Legal Status in Pennsylvania (Updated January 2025)
Skill games were ruled LEGAL by Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court in December 2023. The unanimous ruling found that skill-based games are not gambling devices because they require player skill to determine outcomes.

**Supreme Court Update**: The case is now before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 20, 2025. A decision is pending. While the Supreme Court reviews the case, skill games remain legal and operational throughout Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania currently has approximately 80,000 skill game machines in operation statewide.
