                <p class="lead">One of the first questions business owners ask is "How much money can I actually make with skill games?" Here are real numbers based on Pennsylvania locations across different business types.</p>

                <h2>Average Monthly Revenue by Location Type</h2>
                <p>These figures represent the location's share after revenue split with the operator (typically 35-50% to the location):</p>

                <table class="comparison-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Location Type</th>
                            <th>Average Monthly Revenue</th>
                            <th>Top Performers</th>

                <h2>Factors That Affect Your Revenue</h2>

                <h3>1. Foot Traffic</h3>
                <p>The single biggest factor in skill game revenue is how many people visit your location. High-traffic locations in busy areas consistently outperform quieter spots.</p>

                <h3>2. Operating Hours</h3>
                <p>Locations open late (especially bars) tend to earn more. The evening and late-night hours are peak playing times. A bar open until 2 AM will typically earn more than one that closes at midnight.</p>

                <h3>3. Demographics</h3>
                <p>Blue-collar areas and working-class neighborhoods often show stronger skill game performance. Players tend to be adults 25-55 with disposable income for entertainment.</p>

                <h3>4. Machine Placement</h3>
                <p>Visibility matters. Machines placed in high-traffic areas of your business (near the bar, by the entrance) outperform those tucked in back corners.</p>

                <h3>5. Number of Machines</h3>
                <p>More machines generally means more revenue, but there's a sweet spot based on your location size. We help determine the optimal number for your space.</p>

                <h3>6. Machine Quality and Variety</h3>
                <p>Premium machines with popular games attract more players. Having a mix of different cabinets keeps players engaged.</p>

                <h2>Revenue Share vs. Buying: Impact on Earnings</h2>

                <h3>Revenue Share Model</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>$0 upfront cost</li>
                    <li>Location typically receives 35-50% of net revenue</li>
                    <li>Maintenance and service included</li>
                    <li>Lower risk, consistent passive income</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Purchase Model (JVL Only)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upfront machine cost ($4,000-$8,000 per unit)</li>
                    <li>Keep 100% of revenue</li>
                    <li>Responsible for maintenance (or purchase service plan)</li>
                    <li>Higher potential return, more responsibility</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Real Examples from Pennsylvania</h2>

                <h3>Philadelphia Neighborhood Bar</h3>
                <p>A corner bar in South Philadelphia with 3 machines earns approximately $3,200/month for the owner. Open until 2 AM with steady local traffic.</p>

                <h3>Pittsburgh Convenience Store</h3>
                <p>A busy c-store near a residential area with 2 machines brings in about $1,800/month. The machines draw customers who also make purchases.</p>

                <h3>Allentown Game Room</h3>
                <p>A dedicated game room with 12 machines generates over $12,000/month for the owner. Located on a busy commercial strip with ample parking.</p>

                <h2>How to Maximize Your Earnings</h2>
